This is a small demostration of Semantic Similarity in NLP and how machine language can be used to achieve artificial intelligence

A system that will tell you what to watch next based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies.

Create a function to return which movies a user would watch next if they have watched ​ Planet Hulk with the description “Will he save their world or destroy it? When the Hulk becomes too dangerous for the Earth, the Illuminati trick Hulk into a shuttle and launch him into space to a planet where the Hulk can live in peace. Unfortunately, Hulk land on the planet Sakaar where he is sold into slavery and trained as a gladiator.”
